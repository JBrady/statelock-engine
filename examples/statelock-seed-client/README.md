# statelock-seed Client (Archived Example)

`statelock-seed` is treated as an exploratory client prototype, not the canonical product codebase.

Canonical repo for StateLock product/API work:

- `JBrady/statelock-engine`

If you keep `statelock-seed`, use it only as a consumer example against:

- StateLock memory API (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
- LiteLLM model router (`http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1`)
